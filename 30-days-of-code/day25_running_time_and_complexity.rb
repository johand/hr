# Task

# A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other
# than 1 and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's Prime
# or Not prime.

# NOTE: If possible, try to come up with a O(Math.sqrt(n)) primality algorithm,
# or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be
# sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
# Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for
# primality.

# Constraints

# * 1 <= T <= 30
# * 1 <= n <= 2 * 10**9

# Output Format

# For each test case, print whether n is Prime or Not prime on a new line.

# Sample Input

# 3
# 12
# 5
# 7

# Sample Output

# Not prime
# Prime
# Prime

# Explanation

# Test Case 0: n = 12.
# 12 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (i.e.: 2, 3, 6), so we
# print Not prime on a new line.

# Test Case 1: n = 5.
# 5 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.

# Test Case 2: n = 7.
# 7 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
