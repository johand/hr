# Task

# Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that
# takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign
# initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not
# negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor
# should set to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition,
# you must write the following instance methods:

# 1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
# 2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
#  * If age, < 13 print You are young..
#  * If age >= 13 and age < 18 print You are a teenager
#  * Otherwise, print You are old..

# To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is
# provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code
# that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't
# worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

# Note: Do not remove or alter the stub code in the editor.

# Input Format

# Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.

# The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases), and the T
# subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting the age of a Person
# instance.

# Constraints
# * 1 <= T <= 4
# * -5 <= age <= 30

# Output Format

# Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the
# specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is already in the
# editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case will print 2
# or 3 lines (depending on whether or not a valid initialAge was passed to the
# constructor).

# Sample Input

# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16
# 18

# Sample Output

# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.

# You are young.
# You are a teenager.

# You are a teenager.
# You are old.

# You are old.
# You are old.

# Explanation

# Test Case 0: initialAge = -1
# Because initialAge < 0, our code must set age to 0 and print the "Age is not
# valid..." message followed by the young message. Three years pass and age = 3,
# so we print the young message again.

# Test Case 1: initialAge = 10
# Because initialAge < 13, our code should print that the person is young. Three
# years pass and age = 13, so we print that the person is now a teenager.

# Test Case 2: initialAge = 16
# Because 13 <= initialAge < 18, our code should print that the person is a
# teenager. Three years pass and age = 19, so we print that the person is old.

# Test Case 3: initialAge = 18
# Because initialAge >= 18, our code should print that the person is old. Three
# years pass and the person is still old at age = 21, so we print the old
# message again.
